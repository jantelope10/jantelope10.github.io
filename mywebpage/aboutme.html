    <p style= "font-family: 'Cambria'; font-size:25px; color:orangered;">&#128516 <u><b>About Me:</b></u> My name is Jacob Sanchez and I am a freshman attending Grand Canyon University.
    I am from Orange County, California and an out-of-state student. I am currently majoring in Software Development and thinking about adding a minor
    in Cybersecurity. <br> My hobbies include watching and playing baseball, programming, working out, listening to music, and just hanging out with people
    in general. I've been in love with baseball since I was a kid and have enjoyed playing it since. I also enjoy watching most sports in general. 
    My dad is a software developer and got me interested in programming, which I enjoy doing. <br> I plan to get into a software development career 
    that involves programming. I also plan to get internships in the future to further my success in obtaining a job immediately after attending 
    college. I want to explore the Honors programs that GCU has to offer as well to add on my resume and increase my experience. <br> In terms of computer 
    science, I have little experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, but I have lots of experience using Java. In highschool, I took AP Computer Science 
    Applications, which allows you to completely learn the language of Java. I enjoy making small Java projects and I want to extend my knowledge and 
    incorporate other languages into my toolbox.</p>
