    <p>&#128516 <u><b>About Me:</b></u> My name is Jacob Sanchez and I am a freshman attending Grand Canyon University.
    I am from Orange County, California and an out-of-state student. I am currently majoring in Software Development and thinking about adding a 
    minor in Cybersecurity. <br> My hobbies include watching and playing baseball, programming, working out, listening to music, and just hanging 
    out with people in general. I've been in love with baseball since I was a kid and have enjoyed playing it since. I also enjoy watching most 
    sports in general. My dad is a software developer and got me interested in programming, which I enjoy doing. <br> I plan to get into a software 
    development career that involves programming. I also plan to get internships in the future to further my success in obtaining a job immediately 
    after attending college. I want to explore the Honors programs that GCU has to offer as well to add on my resume and increase my experience. 
    <br> In terms of computer science, I have little experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, but I have lots of experience using Java. In 
    highschool, I took AP Computer Science Applications, which allows you to completely learn the language of Java. I enjoy making small Java 
    projects and I want to extend my knowledge and incorporate other languages into my toolbox.</p>
